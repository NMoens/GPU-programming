# Serial

These are serial versions of some of the application used to illustrate GPU
offloading.  They can be used as starting points for exercises or for
benchmarking.


## What is it?

1. `vector_product_cpu.c`: vector multiplication example.
1. `julia.c`: application that computes the Julia set.
1. `contract_data_field_scalar`: application that computes a contraction of a
   data field with a scalar.
1. `molecular_dynamics`: application that performs a (very naive) molecular
   dynamics computation.
1. `random_walks.cpp`: application that simulates random walks of a given
   number of steps and writes the distribution of the final positions to
   standard output.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
