for exercises or for benchmarking.


## What is it?

1. `vector_product_cpu.c`: vector multiplication example.
1. `julia.c`: application that computes the Julia set.
1. `molecular_dynamics.cpp`: application that performs a (very naive)
   molecular dynamics computation.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
