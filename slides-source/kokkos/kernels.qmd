## Why kernels?

- Don't program your own matrix-matrix multiplication!
- Portable performance
- Can use vendor libraries

## Which kernels?

- Dense linear algebra: BLAS, batched BLAS, some LAPACK
- Sparse linear algebra, CRS (Compressed Row Storage)
- Graph algorithms: distance-1/distance-2 graph coloring, bipartite graph coloring
- Sparse solvers: variants of Gauss-Seidel
- ODE solvers: explicit Runge-Kutta, implicit BDF, Newton
